# Graphical Abstract

---------------------------

1. Problem: head pose estimation, meaning 6 parameters: head location (3) + orientation (3)
	- head location: 3 coordinates wrt reference frame
	- orientation: 3 rotation angles (roll, pitch, yaw)

2. Motivation:
	- fast: real time
	- reliable: over standard data sets and practice
	- robust: occlusion, pose variations, expressions
	- automatic: no manual initialization necessary (provided head is there, no detection scheme)
	- computationally less expensive (compared to [4], no need for graphics hardware)

3. Application:
	- interactive software using head pose + movements (kinect games)
	- embedded on car (several projects on this already, refer Cansen)
	- identification
	- facial analysis

4. Existing Methods:
  1. 2-D
	- brightness
	- tracking features
	- annotation
  2. 3-D
	- require manual initialization 
	- cannot handle large pose variations
	- not real time
	- computationally expensive
	- occlusions (nose tip required for [4])

# Discussions

---------------------------

1. Random regression forests
	- subsample data set, also features? i.e. for a feature set [x1,â€¦,xn] train a decision tree with only [x2,x3]?
2. Add a smoothness constraint in the pose determination? 
since the method is real time, assuming the head is detected in each consecutive frame, the pose should vary smoothly i.e. have a smooth transition between frames. If the video is observed, around the 1:05 mark, the normal vectors jumps. This is because the computation is for each frame, independently of the previous. 
3. Observe when variance is high in the video of real time working of the system.


 # Questions

---------------------------

1. Why 2.5D output of the range scanner? (pg. 618) probably Cansen
2. Range images - resolution 640x480 pixels in ETH data set. Why is the resolution of range images not 3D, and correct to say pixels, or points? Information obtained is point cloud.
3. What are integral images? (pg. 621)
3. What happens with multiple faces/objects in the field of view? (no head detection algorithm implemented)- multiple hypotheses possible? (they assume head has been detected, so perhaps not addressed or not aimed to be addressed in this paper/implementation)
